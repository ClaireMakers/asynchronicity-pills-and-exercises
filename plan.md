thinking about: 

- a separate pill for callbacks 
- some videos to break down the concepts of asynchronicity
- an explanation of the syntax of promises, plus some video demonstration
- some exercises - predict what a certain value will be at a certain execution point

from then on, could go back to normal curriculum, hitting APIs and such, or maybe mixing it up with the new stuff

we could instead talk about functions as arguments a bit more clearly instead. 

might have to reviese some of the stuff about callbacks as well - maybe that's where the stuff about promises should live?
