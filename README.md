Thinking about: 

- Amending the pill about callbacks that would focus on them being functions passed as argument, rather than as ways to handle asynchronicity. Callbacks aren't just used in the context of asynchronous programming, and I've found that this has been an area of confusion for students. 

- The addition of a pill about Asynchronicity that would cover how it works in JavaScript, as well as the basic syntax for promises.

- It would include video demonstrations of the concepts at hand: 
    - One video with an example of a web page sending many requests at once, and the influence of network speed on these to show that we're dealing with operations that take time to run. 

    - Another video to cover the syntax of promises and how they work. 

- Some exercises - I'll add exercises to predict what a value will be at different point of the run time of some code, and then an exercise to get them to write their own first promise chain using fetch or similar. 

This would then be connected back to the curriculum as it exists, with the challenges as they are. In the long run, I might also add content as to how to write tests with ansynchronous operations, but that might need to wait a little bit because I don't know if I'll have time to do it properly before we run the module next.
